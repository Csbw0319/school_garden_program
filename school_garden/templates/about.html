        The school garden offers a place to enrich teaching efforts with powerful hands-on experiences that make learning come alive.
Why plant a school garden? School gardens have entered the national spotlight as an effective way to promote life-long healthy eating habits and connect students to the natural world.  Gardening provides educators with opportunities to enhance student education through practical, reality-based learning. Goals of school garden programs often include:

       <br> -Improvement in attitudes towards fruits and vegetables
        <br>-Improvement in science achievement scores
       <br> - Improvement in social skills and behaviors
